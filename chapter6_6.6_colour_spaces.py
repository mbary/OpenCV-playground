In this book, we have only explored the RGB color space; however, 
there are many other color spaces that we can uti- lize.

The Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space is more similar to how humans think and conceive of color. 
Then there is the L*a*b* color space, which is more tuned to how hu- mans perceive color.

OpenCV provides support for many, many different color spaces. And understanding how color 
is perceived by humans and represented by computers occupies an entire li- brary of literature itself.

In order to not get bogged down in the details, Iâ€™ll just show you how to convert color spaces. 
If you think your application of image processing and computer vision might need a different color 
space than RGB, I will leave that as an exercise to the reader to explore the peculiarities of each color space.
